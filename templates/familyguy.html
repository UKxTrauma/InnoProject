I love that song.<br><br>I'll let you have sex with my daughter.<br><br>I don't know. Let's see your daughter.<br><br>She's right there.<br><br>Okay. I'll do her.<br><br>But can you tell her to cry and beg me to stop?<br><br>I think that can be arranged.<br><br>Peter, will you give that song a rest?<br><br>You've been playing it since we got home.<br><br>No way, Lois. It's my new favorite thing in the world.<br><br>Lois, I'm gonna ask you this only once.<br><br>Do you or do you not... know about the bird?<br><br>Oh, God.<br><br>Everybody's heard that the bird is the word.<br><br>A- bird, bird, bird The bird's the word A- bird, bird, bird The bird is the word A- bird, bird, bird...<br><br>Ow!<br><br>Oh, God.

That's odd.<br><br>I thought that would be big news.<br><br>What would be big news?<br><br>Well, there seems to be an absence of a certain ornithological piece.<br><br>A headline regarding mass awareness of a certain avian variety.<br><br>What are you talking about?<br><br>Oh, have you not heard?<br><br>It was my understanding that everyone had heard.<br><br>Heard what?<br><br>Don't!<br><br>A- well-a bird, bird, bird B- Bird is the word A- well-a bird, bird, bird B- Bird is the word A- well-a bird, bird, bird B- Bird is the word A- well-a bird, bird, bird B- Bird is the word Brian, don't you know about the bird?<br><br>Well, Peter's gonna tell you About the bird A- well-a bird, bird B- Bird is the word A- well-a bird... Surfin '<br><br>Oh, my God, Peter. Are you all right?<br><br>I was just at the bank and they told me... you withdrew $6000 cash from our savings.<br><br>That's everything we have. What the hell was it for?<br><br>I bought some local TV airtime, Lois.<br><br>And I did a public-service announcement of vital importance.<br><br>Thank you. Hi, I'm Peter Griffin.<br><br>There's an issue facing many Americans today... that concerns a great number of us.<br><br>According to Gallup Polls... one in 12 Americans is unaware that the bird is the word.<br><br>I dream of an America where everybody knows that the bird is the word.<br><br>A- bird, bird, bird Bird's the word A- well-a bird, bird, bird Well, the bird is the word<br><br>My God, is it possible?<br><br>Have the boys in the lab confirm this.<br><br>Sir, our math shows that the bird is equal to or greater than the word.<br><br>Check it again!<br><br>Brian?<br><br>Yeah?<br><br>I don't feel so good.<br><br>That's it. We gotta do something.<br><br>We have got to get that record and destroy it.<br><br>Just like that fat-person surgery destroyed Star Jones' arms.<br><br>I look so good. I lost all this weight.<br><br>Taxi!<br><br>Coming to show the people how good I look.<br><br>B- Bird, bird, bird B- Bird, bird, bird Don't you know about the bird?<br><br>Everybody knows That the bird is the word<br><br>Who did it?<br><br>Who did what, Pop?<br><br>Yes, Peter, what has you upset?<br><br>Surfin ' Bird is gone.<br><br>I took it to bed, had sex with it, it fell asleep in my arms. It's gone.<br><br>Well, Peter, nobody here would steal from you.<br><br>Oh, no one had a motive? You all had a motive. Every one of you.<br><br>You knew that I changed my will and left everything to the record.<br><br>Meg wanted a passport for her twin sister to get out of the country.<br><br>But Meg didn't count on me discovering she has no twin... and that Meg was released from the sanitarium.<br><br>That's where Chris came in.<br><br>So you got it all figured it out, do you? You couldn't leave well enough alone.<br><br>You won't fire at me, Chris. You don't got the stomach for it.<br><br>Ha, ha, ha. I'm sorry, Dad. I have no idea what you're talking about.<br><br>Well, it sure is odd. A record doesn't just get up and walk away.<br><br>Except for my old Allan Sherman record.<br><br>If you ain't gonna play me, don't complain when I split.<br><br>There's a lot of Jews still get a laugh off of "Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah.<br><br>" Oh, such heat this morning. I don't need this jacket.<br><br>The hell with you.<br><br>I'm going downtown and buy another copy of Surfin ' Bird.<br><br>Peter, that's not necessary. I'm sure it'll turn up somewhere.<br><br>I wouldn't count on it, Lois.<br><br>Do you have Surfin ' Bird by the Trashmen?<br><br>No, I'm sorry.<br><br>A dog and a baby came in and bought all 63 copies.<br><br>Damn it. This is the third used-record store with that same story.<br><br>You, uh... You look familiar. Do I know you?<br><br>Did you go to North Providence?<br><br>No.<br><br>You friends with Gary, owns the dry-cleaner's?<br><br>No.<br><br>Are you Jesus Christ?<br><br>No.<br><br>Oh, my God. You are.<br><br>You're Jesus Christ.<br><br>No, I'm not.<br><br>I'm just a guy working at a record store.<br><br>Huh.<br><br>If you're not Jesus Christ... you won't mind if I pee on these Amy Grant CDs.<br><br>Don't.<br><br>Aha! You are Jesus.<br><br>Yes, I am.<br><br>Oh, my God. Jesus Christ, the Messiah.<br><br>You've returned. You've returned to bring us the good word.<br><br>What word?<br><br>A- well-a bird, bird, bird B- Bird is the word A- well-a bird, bird, bird B- Bird is the word A- well-a bird, bird, bird B- Bird is the word A- well-a bird, bird, bird B- Bird is the word A- well-a bird, bird B- Bird is the word<br><br>Jesus Christ has returned to Earth.<br><br>I can't believe it. The Second Coming.<br><br>Keep it down. It's not the Second Coming.<br><br>Okay, so, what are you doing here?<br><br>Well, believe it or not, I pop in every hundred years or so.<br><br>Kind of incognito, just to get away from the family.<br><br>Plus the timing seemed good.<br><br>My dad quit smoking, and he's a little on edge.<br><br>Who took my checkbook?<br><br>Ellen?<br><br>Why is there a pen cap and no pen?<br><br>You're the first person to recognize me in 2000 years.<br><br>You seem like a nice guy. Come over to my house for dinner.<br><br>Okay, but I don't get off until 7.<br><br>Great, we'll have a blast.<br><br>We can watch that YouTube footage of Marlee Matlin calling Moviefone.<br><br>Please say the name of the movie you'd like to see now.<br><br>The Last Mimzy.<br><br>I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.<br><br>Please say the name of the movie you'd like to see now.<br><br>The Last Mimzy.<br><br>You have selected 300.<br><br>If this is the movie you'd like to see, say "yes" now.<br><br>No.<br><br>You have confirmed 300.<br><br>Wow, Jesus Christ at our dinner table.<br><br>I still can't get over it.<br><br>I'm glad you're all here tonight.<br><br>I wanna tell you that one of you will betray me.<br><br>No, just kidding.<br><br>Ah. He's doing that thing he did in the storybook.<br><br>So, Jesus, finish that story you were telling.<br><br>Oh, all right. So there I was. They had just b*at me senseless... stuck thorns in my head, nailed me to a piece of wood... shoved a sponge full of vinegar in my mouth and k*ll me.<br><br>Then they put me in a hole with a rock in front of it for two whole days.<br><br>And come Sunday, bam, I rise from the dead.<br><br>Okay, that sounds like a nutty weekend. But I can top it.<br><br>So me and Cleveland and Joe are just wrecked on Southern Comfort.<br><br>We know we'll puke. But Joe says, "Let's go see Chronicles of Riddick.<br><br>" Sat through the whole thing without puking.<br><br>Then I get home. Wouldn't you know, I lost my glasses. Eh?<br><br>Peter, one. Jesus, zero.<br><br>If I get my cell phone, would you mind talking to my friend Muriel Goldman?<br><br>I really just wanna stick this up her ass.<br><br>I'll be the one to say it.<br><br>How do we know you're really Jesus? Can you perform miracles?<br><br>Sure. How about this?<br><br>Oh, boy. Sundaes.<br><br>I love you, Jesus.<br><br>I love you too, fella.<br><br>Jesus, can you do something for me?<br><br>Sure, Peter, what is it?<br><br>Listen, Jesus, I know you're trying to keep a low profile... but there's one person I really want you to meet.<br><br>Oh, yeah? Who's that?<br><br>The American people may have turned against the w*r.<br><br>But I answer to a higher power.<br><br>I answer to the power of Jesus Christ.<br><br>That's funny, because I happen to have Jesus Christ right here.<br><br>I heard what you were saying. You know nothing of my work.<br><br>How you got to be president of anything is totally amazing.<br><br>Wouldn't it be great if life were like this?<br><br>Listen, thanks for coming by tonight and hanging out with us.<br><br>You may look like a bum, but you got a lot of talent, young man.<br><br>Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I have had a blast.<br><br>Oh, wonderful, wonderful.<br><br>I'd forgotten how great it is interacting with people.<br><br>I better get some sleep. I gotta open the store tomorrow.<br><br>You don't wanna go back to that store. You gotta get out there.<br><br>Coloring eggs and hiding them for kids.<br><br>What, you mean reveal myself?<br><br>Absolutely. This world needs you, Jesus.<br><br>It needs you like a guy who can't get it up needs a distraction.<br><br>I am so ready to have sex with you.<br><br>Oh, hey, is that my phone?<br><br>I don't hear anything.<br><br>Is that John Astin?<br><br>I don't see anyone out there.<br><br>Oh, well, now there's so much going on.<br><br>You know, you're right, Peter. It may be time. But how do we do it?<br><br>Everyone, may I have your attention, please?<br><br>I would like to introduce you to the one, the only, Jesus Christ.<br><br>That's right. That's Jesus Christ right here.<br><br>Jesus Christ.<br><br>Yeah, right.<br><br>These idiots, they're not listening.<br><br>You know what, we gotta prove it to them.<br><br>Listen, I'm gonna go get some water.<br><br>You're gonna turn it into wine.<br><br>Cool.<br><br>Hey, can you get me a Cracked magazine?<br><br>Cracked?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Jesus Christ, unbelievable.<br><br>All right, I'll be back.<br><br>Oh, crap.<br><br>Don't worry. I'll get it.<br><br>Oh, my God. It's Jesus.<br><br>It's him. It's Jesus.<br><br>And his best pal, Peter. Oh. Oh. Oh.<br><br>Oh, wow.<br><br>Fifteen minutes, Mr. Christ.<br><br>Wow.<br><br>Jesus, can you believe you're gonna get to meet Jay Leno?<br><br>Why is it when Jesus revealed himself to the world, he became famous... and when I did, I got suspended for five days?<br><br>You know, I owe this all to you, Peter. You gave me the confidence I needed.<br><br>Never mind about that. Just go out there and knock them dead.<br><br>Now, who are you?<br><br>Jesus Christ.<br><br>Who are you?<br><br>Jesus Christ.<br><br>Who are you?<br><br>Jesus Christ!<br><br>Now go get them.<br><br>Well, my thanks again to Dave Coulier.<br><br>Season three of Full House is out on DVD March 5th.<br><br>My next guest died for our sins, and it looks like he's back on the scene.<br><br>Please welcome from the Bible, Jesus Christ.

Dane Cook here in the house at the MTV Movie Awards.<br><br>What's up? What's up? You know what I hate?<br><br>When you eat an ice-cream cone, and it's cold, and you're all: You're like, " Why didn't you warn me that's so cold?"<br><br>He's like, "It's ice cream. " You're like, "Oh, man.<br><br>" But chicks don't do that because they use a spoon.<br><br>Ah. What's up? Su-Fi. Boo.<br><br>MySpace.<br><br>Is he saying something funny?<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>But he's moving around a lot, so I guess.<br><br>Ha-ha.<br><br>He was on the lnternet, and I'm in college. Ha-ha. Now to present the award... for sickest on-screen gangsta pimp-out business... Jesus Christ and the Pussycat Dolls.<br><br>Yay, Jesus! That's my buddy, Jesus.<br><br>Hey, it's a pleasure to be here with you six interchangeable women.<br><br>Last time I was down here on Earth, I only hung around with one whore.<br><br>Come on, guys. Let's head over to my crib.<br><br>Hey, you mind scooting over a little bit?<br><br>Ooh, sorry. Doesn't look like there's any room.<br><br>What...? What do you mean?<br><br>There's only one space left, and I promised it to that cow.<br><br>This is gonna be fun. I'm gonna stick my head out the sunroof... and wave my arms and go, "Whoo! I'm in Hollywood.<br><br>" Whoo! I'm in Hollywood! See? I said I'd do it.<br><br>Put that thing away. We're trying to eat dinner.<br><br>I can't believe f*cking Jesus hasn't called. I left him a message four hours ago.<br><br>Maybe he doesn't have his phone.<br><br>No, it rang twice, and then the voicemail picked up.<br><br>If it had gone straight to voicemail, the phone was off.<br><br>If it rang six times, that means he didn't hear it.<br><br>But it rang twice, Lois.<br><br>That means the phone rang, he saw it was me... he pressed a button and sent it to voicemail. You know what, give me your phone. I bet he'll pick up. Hey, hey, Lois. Hey, you, it's Peter.<br><br>We were supposed to do something today.<br><br>Uh, I forgot to tell you. I have a doctor's appointment today.<br><br>I'm actually there now.<br><br>Hey, look. Lindsay Lohan just took her top off.<br><br>Hey, I just drank a beer. Who wants to do me?<br><br>I do. Me too.<br><br>I just did you, but I'll go again I gotta go.<br><br>Can you believe the way Jesus is treating me?<br><br>I thought he was my friend.<br><br>Look, fame and success do crazy things to people, Peter.<br><br>I'm sure deep down, he's still the same old Jesus.<br><br>He may need to figure that out in his own way.<br><br>
                Maybe. But one thing's for sure, Lois. None of this would have happened...<br><br>...if somebody hadn't stolen my f*cking Surfin ' Bird record.<br><br>Tonight's top story. Local record-shop employee Jesus Christ... was found in Mary-Kate Olsen's apartment... face down and unconscious.<br><br>Police revived and arrested the disoriented Jesus... who was quoted as saying, "Jews are responsible for all the world's wars.<br><br>" Brian, you think that's our Jesus?<br><br>Griffin residence, Peter speaking.<br><br>Oh, yeah? Why should I?<br><br>Well, get someone else to bail you out because it ain't gonna be me.<br><br>Well, what are you gonna do about it?<br><br>All right, I'm coming.<br><br>Jesus Christ, look at you.<br><br>You had it all: Money, fame, eternal life.<br><br>The perfect hand for masturbating. And you blew it.<br><br>You let it all go to your head.<br><br>I know, Peter.<br><br>I guess it turns out I'm just as human as anyone else.<br><br>Yeah? Well, what do we do now?<br><br>You want the truth? I think it's time for me to go.<br><br>This world's not ready for me yet. And I'm not ready for it.<br><br>I don't know, maybe I'll try coming back in another thousand years... when I'm more mature.<br><br>Well, that's a very mature thing to say right there.<br><br>I think you're on your way.<br><br>Well, before I go, Peter, there's something I wanna give you.<br><br>Hold out your hands.<br><br>Well, I guess that's it then. Jesus is gone.<br><br>I sure am gonna miss him.<br><br>Me too.<br><br>He did give me something before he disappeared.<br><br>What?<br><br>Something very special, Lois.<br><br>What is it, Dad?<br><br>What? You haven't heard?<br><br>f*ck!<br><br>A- well-a bird, bird, bird B- Bird is the word A- well-a bird, bird, bird B- Bird is the word A- well-a bird, bird, bird B- Bird is the word
